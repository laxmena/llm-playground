# LLM Playground

Welcome to the LLM Playground! This repository is a space for me to experiment with and learn about Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Agents, Langchain, and other related technologies.

## Current Contents

This repository currently includes:

* **RAG Application:**
    * Use Retrieval Augmented Generation using Langchain.
    * Includes functionalities for:
        * Generating quizzes from web content.
        * Extracting information from runbooks (PDFs and text files).

As I continue to learn and experiment, I will be adding more projects and examples to this repository.


## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd llm-playground
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    * Add your API keys and any other necessary environment variables.

        ```
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        ```

4.  **Explore the contents:**
    * Navigate to the relevant ipynb file to run the RAG application.
    * Follow the instructions within each notebook or script to run the specific examples.

## Learning and Contributing

This is primarily a personal learning repository. However, if you have any suggestions or find any issues, feel free to open an issue.

## Future Plans

I plan to add more diverse projects and examples, including:

* Agent-based applications
* Fine-tuning experiments
* Exploration of different LLM frameworks and tools.
* More diverse RAG implementations.
