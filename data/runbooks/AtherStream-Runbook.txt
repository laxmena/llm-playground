**AetherStream Context:**

* **Functionality:** AetherStream ingests high-volume data streams from various sources (IoT devices, APIs, etc.), performs real-time transformations and aggregations using AWS Kinesis Data Streams and AWS Lambda, and then delivers the processed data to downstream systems (data warehouses, dashboards).
* **Architecture:**
    * Data sources -> AWS Kinesis Data Streams -> AWS Lambda (processing) -> AWS S3/Redshift/Elasticsearch.
    * Uses CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
    * IAM roles for secure access between AWS services.

**AetherStream Runbook: Data Pipeline Failure**

**1. Purpose:**

* To provide a structured approach to diagnosing and resolving failures in the AetherStream real-time data processing pipeline.

**2. Scope:**

* This runbook covers issues related to data ingestion, processing, and delivery within the AetherStream pipeline.

**3. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Incident Commander:** Manages the incident, coordinates troubleshooting efforts, and communicates updates.
* **Pipeline Engineer:** Executes the runbook steps, analyzes logs, and implements fixes.
* **Data Engineer:** Provides expertise on data transformations and downstream system integrations.
* **Cloud Operations:** Manages AWS infrastructure and access.

**4. Prerequisites:**

* AWS Management Console access with appropriate IAM roles.
* AWS CLI and necessary tools (e.g., jq).
* Access to CloudWatch Logs and Metrics.
* Familiarity with Kinesis Data Streams, Lambda, and downstream systems.

**5. Failure Scenarios:**

* **5.1. Data Ingestion Failure:**
    * Source system outage.
    * Network connectivity issues.
    * Kinesis Data Stream throttling.
* **5.2. Lambda Processing Failure:**
    * Lambda function errors or exceptions.
    * Lambda timeouts.
    * IAM role permissions issues.
    * Lambda code deployment error.
    * Dependency errors.
* **5.3. Data Delivery Failure:**
    * Downstream system outage.
    * S3 bucket access issues.
    * Redshift connection errors.
    * Elasticsearch cluster issues.
* **5.4. Data Quality Issues:**
    * Incorrect data transformations in Lambda.
    * Data schema changes.
    * Data corruption.

**6. Troubleshooting Steps:**

* **6.1. Monitor CloudWatch Metrics:**
    * Check Kinesis Data Stream metrics (e.g., `IncomingBytes`, `PutRecords.Success`).
    * Monitor Lambda metrics (e.g., `Errors`, `Duration`, `Throttles`).
    * Verify downstream system metrics (e.g., S3 write operations, Redshift query failures).
* **6.2. Review CloudWatch Logs:**
    * Examine Kinesis Data Stream logs for ingestion errors.
    * Analyze Lambda function logs for errors and exceptions.
    * Check downstream system logs for connection and write errors.
* **6.3. Verify Service Health:**
    * Check the status of AWS services (Kinesis, Lambda, S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch).
    * Verify network connectivity between services.
* **6.4. Check IAM Roles and Policies:**
    * Ensure that Lambda functions and other services have the necessary permissions.
* **6.5. Data Validation:**
    * Sample data from Kinesis and downstream systems to verify data integrity.
    * Run data quality checks.
* **6.6. Code Deployment Verification:**
    * If a recent code deploy occured, verify the new code, and if needed, roll back to the previous version.

**7. Onboarding Guide:**

* **7.1. Service Overview:**
    * Explain the AetherStream architecture and data flow.
    * Provide access to documentation and diagrams.
* **7.2. AWS Access:**
    * Grant access to the AWS Management Console and necessary services.
    * Provide training on using AWS CLI and CloudWatch.
* **7.3. Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * Explain how to use CloudWatch dashboards and alerts.
    * Provide instructions on setting up custom alerts.
* **7.4. Runbook Training:**
    * Walk through the runbook and explain troubleshooting steps.
    * Conduct simulated incident scenarios.

**8. Ticket Metrics:**

* **8.1. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Track the average time to resolve incidents.
* **8.2. Incident Frequency:** Monitor the number of incidents per time period.
* **8.3. Incident Severity:** Categorize incidents based on impact.
* **8.4. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Completion:** Track the percentage of incidents with completed RCAs.
* **8.5. Customer Impact:** Track the number of customers affected by incidents.

**9. FAQ:**

* **Q: How do I check Kinesis Data Stream metrics?**
    * A: In CloudWatch, go to "Metrics" and select "Kinesis."
* **Q: How do I view Lambda function logs?**
    * A: In CloudWatch, go to "Logs" and find the Lambda function's log group.
* **Q: What IAM permissions are required for Lambda?**
    * A: The Lambda function needs permissions to access Kinesis, S3, Redshift, and CloudWatch.
* **Q: How do I roll back a Lambda deployment?**
    * A: Within the lambda console, you can select previous published versions, and publish that version.
* **Q: How do I get an alert on Kinesis throttling?**
    * A: Create a CloudWatch alarm based on the `PutRecords.ThrottledRecords` metric.

**10. Debugging:**

* **10.1. Local Testing:**
    * Use AWS SAM CLI to simulate Kinesis events and test Lambda functions locally.
* **10.2. Log Analysis:**
    * Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and filter logs.
    * Search for error messages and stack traces.
* **10.3. Remote Debugging:**
    * Use AWS X-Ray to trace requests and identify bottlenecks.
    * Use Lambda layers to add debugging libraries.
* **10.4. Data Sampling:**
    * Sample data at each stage of the pipeline to identify data quality issues.
    * Use tools like `jq` to parse JSON data.
